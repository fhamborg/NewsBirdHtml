# NewsBirdHtml

This is the source code of the client component of the NewsBird project. You can find the source code of the server at https://github.com/fhamborg/NewsBirdServer.
Please note that we are currently preparing both repositories, which mainly will include
* add a documentation how to setup the tool
* remove code that is not required any longer in the final version of NewsBird

If you have any question until then, please just send a mail to felix.hamborg@uni-konstanz.de.
